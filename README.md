# flask-mega-tutorial
This is the repo for my go-through of the flask mega tutorial by Miguel Grinberg (@miguelgrinberg). I'm attempting to update where I can when
the tutorial is out of date (due to its size and the effort that goes into maintaining such a beast).

I'm adding some different niceties as I go through, but for the most part I'm sticking to the tutorial (for now).
